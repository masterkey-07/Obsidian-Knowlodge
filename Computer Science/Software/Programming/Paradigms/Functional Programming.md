**Immutability** : Variables and Objects are Constants, cannot be modified


# Description

- ### Based on [[Lambda Calculus]], Problem Solution By Functions
- ### Uses Immutability to Prevent Unpredictable Change
- ### High Order Functions : Functions as Parameters


# Problems
- ### With Immutability more Arrays and Variables
- #### With More Data, More Process and Memory Consumption 


# Solution in [[Clean Archtecture]]
