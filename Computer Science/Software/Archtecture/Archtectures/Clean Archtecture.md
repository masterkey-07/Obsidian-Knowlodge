# Objective

```ad-note

#### The Only Way to go Fast, is to go Well.

```

### To Provide a Software Quality, to easly mantain and scale it with a good software archtecture and design.\*\*\*\*

## With Quality, it is Cheaper to Develop

# The Two Values of a Project

- ## Behaviour : Functions, Features
  - ##### **Extreme** : If it works and can't change, won't work after need.
- ## Structure : Archtecture, Easy to Change
  - ##### **Extreme** : If it don't works and can change, can make work.

# [[Programming Paradigm]] in Archtecture

## Big Three Concerns of Archtecture :

- ### Function : [[Functional Programming]]![[Functional Programming#^344a93]]

- ### Separation of Components : [[Object Oriented Programming]]![[Object Oriented Programming#^11adb6]]

- ### Data Management : [[Structure Programming]]![[Structure Programming#^8706e6]]

# [[SOLID Principles]] in [[Clean Archtecture]]

### The `Dependency Inversion Principle` will constitute the `Dependency Rule` in [[Clean Archtecture]]

On the one hand, if the bricks aren’t well made, the architecture of the building doesn’t matter much. On the other hand, you can make a substantial mess with well-made bricks.
