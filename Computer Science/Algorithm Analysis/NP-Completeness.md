# Polynomial Time Algorithms


## Rules to be Polynomial Time Solvable
- ### There is a Concrete Problem : Set of Binary Strings
- ### If a Problem of Length  $n$ is done in time $n^k$ so it is a Polynomial Time Problem

## Aspects of a Polynomial Time Program
- ### If there is a problem of order $n^k$ there will be a version faster
- ### A Problem solved in Polynomial Time in a Model can be solved in Polynomial Time in Other
- ### If the output of one Polynomial Time algorithm is fed into the input of another, the composite algorithm is polynomial

## Enconding

- ### Enconding is How the format that data is conceived to the program.

- ### Enconding are important for the Time Complexity of a Program
	-  Example : T(n) takes time of 2 with a number of 10, but takes time

# Reduction

### Task to be reduced to solveble tasks or unsolveble task to prove if it is hard or easy
