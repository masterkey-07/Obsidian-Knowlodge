#### The Capacity of Encapsulation, Inheritance  and Polymorphism

### Everything [[Object Oriented Programming]] can do was already possible, it just made it easier to do.

# Encapsulation

- ### Control the access of functions and properties
- ### Segregation of concepts


# Inheritance

- ### Give Methods and Properties to Children.

# Polymorphism

- ### Functions have the same behaviour with different methodologies
- ### Possible to implement Interfaces, that Allows Dependency Inversion (One of [[SOLID Principles]])
- ### The Power to Segregate and Inverse Dependencies, to allow this Dependencies to function as Plugins.

### Object-oriented programming imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control.
