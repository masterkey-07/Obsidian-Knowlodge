#### Changing Control : Means to jump to another statement (line)

# Uncle Bob View 

### In previous languages, the statement `goto <line>` allowed a free transfer of control (changing the flow of statement), that make it possible of irresponsible changes of control, so [[Edsger Dijkstra]] struggled to imply the [[Structure Programming]] for a new way of programming in the area of Computer Science.

### The Structure Programming removes the possibilitie of `goto` and gives in return `if else, do while, while,` etc...

### For a more disciplined and limited way of changing control

### And the capacity for Functional Decomposition, allowing  high-level functions be divided to lower-level functions

### Making Functions more (mathematically) provable to be false (easy to test).

### Structured programming imposes discipline on direct transfer of control.
