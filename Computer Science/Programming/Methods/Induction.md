title: Polynimial Equation

## $P_n(x) = a_n x ^n + a_{n-1} x ^{n-1} +  ...  + a_1 x + a_0$ 
```

## By Induction 
## $P_n(x) = a_n x ^n + P_{n-1}(x)$

## By Strong Induction 
## $P_n(x) = x P'_{n-1}(x) + a_0$

## $P'_{n-1}(x) = a_nx^{n-1} + a_{n-1}x^{n-2} + \dots + a_1$


## Conclusion
### Having the Solution of $P_{n-1}(x) \text{ or } P'_{n-1}$ it is possible to solve the problem of $P_n(x)$
