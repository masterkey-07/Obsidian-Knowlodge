# Origin

From reading [[Robert C. Martin|Uncle Bob]], [[The Clean Coder]], he says that be in the "Zone" is not a good thing because good software is not produced in this [[Flow State]].

And the questions that comes to mind is

- Is it bad to be a "Zone" Programmer?
- Is it bad to not be a "Zone" Programmer?
- How to be a "Zone" Programmer while using tools that cut your "flow" thinking

# Persona of a "Zone" programmer

Working with this idea, and looking into a group of programmers that hates the work of [[Robert C. Martin|Uncle Bob]] and [[Agile Development]] principles (for example, [[Extreme Programming]]). This hate or strong disagreement, comes because all this tools stop them from the "Zone" state, and stop them being "Awesome" and Blazing Fast and Productive.

They seem to hate [[Software Engineer|Software Engineering]], and just want to write code with the multiple complex algorithms that they have in mind (that all of them come from [[Computer Science]]).

**Things that stop the "Zone"**
- [[Test Driven Development]] make you think deeply with Test First Design
- [[Pair Programming]] make you speak with a co-worker, and speak distract you from the "Flow"
- And others
