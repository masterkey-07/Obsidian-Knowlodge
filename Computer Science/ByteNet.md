- The **ByteNet** is introduced, which is a **one-dimensional  [[Convolutional Neural Network]] (CNN)**. And it is composed of two parts, one to **encode the source sequence** and the other to **decode the target sequence**.


- ByteNet is a **character-level [[Neural Machine Translation]] (NMT) approach,** which means that it performs translation character by character (not word by word).
