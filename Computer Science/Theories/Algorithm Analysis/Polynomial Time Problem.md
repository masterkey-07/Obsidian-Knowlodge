# Polynomial Time Problem (P)

### There is Fast Solutions

## Rules to be Polynomial Time Solvable
- ### There is a Concrete Problem : Set of Binary Strings
- ### If a Problem of Length  $n$ is done in time $n^k$ so it is a Polynomial Time Problem

## Aspects of a Polynomial Time Program
- ### If there is a problem of order $n^k$ there will be a version faster
- ### A Problem solved in Polynomial Time in a Model can be solved in Polynomial Time in Other
- ### If the output of one Polynomial Time algorithm is fed into the input of another, the composite algorithm is polynomial

## Enconding

- ### Enconding is How the format that data is conceived to the program.

- ### Enconding are important for the Time Complexity of a Program
  > The size of the input depends on it Enconding, some encondings make $n$ to $2^n$
