 Is a **Inductive Learning**?

## **Mathematical Definition**

### $$ h(x) = f(x)$$
##### $h(x):$ function found to solve the problem
#####  $f(x):$  goal function, that solves the problem

### $$H = \{h_1, h_2, h_3, \dots\}$$
##### $H:$ set of possible functions, that one of them is the answer

### $h_y(x)$ is consistent if  $x \in S_{test}$  and  $Im(h_y(x)) = S_{answer}$

#### The best $h$ is the most simple (in [[Mathematics]], the most simple equation) by the rule of [[Ockham's Razor]]

### **Types of Learning**
- **Supervised Learning**
	- **All** tests has the true result
- **Non Supervised Learning**
	- **All** tests don't has the truth over the data
	- Use cases: Grouping of Data
- **Semi Supervised Learning**
	- **Some** tests has the true result
	- **Some** tests don't has the truth over the data
- **By Reinforcement**
	- Motivated by the result in real time
	- Use cases: Games
