Concept that is used in [[Multivariable Calculus]]

# Mathematical Definition

## $\text{Being } A \subset R^2$
## $\text{And } B_r(a,b) = \{(x,y) \in R^2 | \lVert(x,y) - (a,b)\rVert < r\}$
## $\text{Is a accumulatiom point if } (x,y) \in A \text{ and } (x,y) \in B_r(a,b) \text{ and } (x,y) \ne (a,b)$
## $\text{An accumulatiom point don't need to be in } A$
## $\text{If } (a,b) \text{ is in } A \text{ and is not an accumulation point so it is an Isolated Point}$


# Idea

If a given point don't have any near value from a give set ($A$), so it is an isolated point, if not, it is an accumulation point.
