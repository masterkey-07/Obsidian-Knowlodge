They discover features (caracteristics of the data) to be applied an any type of application (classifier, regression, etc.)

>Deep learning use [[Neural Network|neural networks]] with multiple layers (deep architectures) to learn hierarchical representations of data. Each layer extracts features from the input data and passes them to the next layer, allowing the network to learn increasingly abstract and complex representations. Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and many others.

Makes the [[Neural Network]] go **deep**, because it applies multiple layers
