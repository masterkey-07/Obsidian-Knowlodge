>[!quote] [Review — Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning (ConvS2S)](https://sh-tsang.medium.com/review-convolutional-sequence-to-sequence-learning-convs2s-510a9eddce05)
>In this story, **Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning**, (ConvS2S), by Facebook AI Research, is briefly reviewed. In this story:
>- An architecture is proposed which is **entirely based on [[Convolutional Neural Network]] (CNN)**.
>- **Computations can be fully parallelized** during training.
>- **Gated linear units (**[**GLU**](https://sh-tsang.medium.com/99bed1316f0b)**) eases gradient propagation** and
>- **Each decoder layer** equipped with a **separate attention module**.
