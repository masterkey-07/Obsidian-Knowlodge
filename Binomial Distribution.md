It is a [[Probability Distribution]]

> [!important] **Recommended Conditions for Usage**
> - Is a problem that has n cases independents
> - Each case is a [[Bernoulli Distribution]], so the probabilities are binary ($p$ and $q=1-p$)
> - The probability of $p$ of success in each case is constant

# Probability Function 

## $$P(X = x) = \binom{n}{k} p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$$

## $$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{x!(n - x)!}$$

## $x = \text{Number of Success} = 0,1, \dots, n$
## $n = \text{Number of Cases}$
## $p = \text{Probability of Success}$
