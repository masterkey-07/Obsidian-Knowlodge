- Monk Dragon Style Build?

I just finished the game yesterday with a very powerful sorceror build if someone is interested, and it was strong and fun the whole game, maybe a little too overpowered sometimes. The build is focused on level 1 to be a Scaled Fist monk with dragon style, Strength and Charisma as high as you can, with Constitution at least 14, Dex could go to 10 or even less, Int enough to get 2 skill points per level, Wisdom 8 or less. I was Tiefling Pitborn for the bonuses to charisma and strength and the higher crit. Always put points in persuasion, 5 points in knowledge arcana for Dragon Disciple, and after switch to Mobility for some extra unarmed feats later on. After the first level in Scaled fist, advance in pure sorceror with a dragon bloodline, your choice, until you meet the prereq for Dragon Disciple, and when you do, advance only 4 levels in that (because level 5 makes you lose one more caster level). After this just go into sorceror until end game, with feats that enhance your unarmed combat, persuasion, and dragon style. Put your extra attribute points at level up in Charisma. As for spells, focus on the ones that enhance your defense, buff you and increase your stats, mainly strength. You reach level 9 spells at lvl 20. At the end you fight as a massive blurred burning mirrored imaged dragon with AC 50, Str 45, higher than any fighter, with decent unarmed damage.
