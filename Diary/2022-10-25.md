Well... 
It's my first time in my life doing a diary
Well, it is not the best time to do it, i am in middle of a fucking hard class, i shouldn't be doing it hahahaha.

So... to be cliche.
Hello Diary, how are you?
I am confused with so much you can't imagine, maybe i am "writing wrong" using brazilian terms to write english, however (i must learn more connections strings) i can do it because it is may diary, maybe a should write it in portuguese? maybe, but i want to "train" my "thinking" and "writing" in english.

Well i am starting to get a little... bored with it. So i am going to finish it here.

Good bye Diary, may we see again in a next time.

Good Bye
