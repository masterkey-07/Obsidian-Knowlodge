- **Atomicity**: Ensures that a series of database operations within a transaction are treated as a single unitâ€”either all operations succeed, or none are applied.
    
- **Consistency**: Guarantees that a transaction takes the database from one valid state to another, maintaining all predefined rules, constraints, and data integrity.
    
- **Isolation**: Ensures that concurrent transactions execute independently, with no unintended interference, providing consistent results as if each transaction ran sequentially.
    
- **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even in the event of a system crash or power failure.
