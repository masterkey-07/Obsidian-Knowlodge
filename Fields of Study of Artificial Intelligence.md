-  Do tasks that is better executed by humans
- Turing Test: If a machine pass a test of human imitation, so it could be said that this machine is intelligent
	- The machines must have at least
		- [[Natural Language Process]]
		- Knowledge Representation
		- Automated Reasoning
		- Some kind of learning
		- The test: www.turinghub.com
- Scientist study the most basic principles of intelligence instead of trying to reproduce one
	-  Example: Airships was made based on aerodynamics, not a reproduction of birds
