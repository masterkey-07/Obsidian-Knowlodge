**Discussion**
[[Sequential Computation|Sequencial]] vs [[Parallelism]] Execution of the Transactions

- With [[Parallelism]]
	- Better throughput (quantity of execution in a period) of transactions
	- Better usage on resource consumption
	- Lower time in the wait of a transaction execution
	- It must ensure integrity of data
	- New Problems: [[Lost Update]], [[Inconsistent Retrieval]], [[Phantom Data?|Phantom]]

**Has Transactions** (Must be [[ACID]])
- Read
- Write
- Start Transaction
- Commit
- Abort
