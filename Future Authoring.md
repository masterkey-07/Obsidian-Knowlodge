When you return, all your previous work will be waiting for you, and you will be taken to the last point in the exercise you had completed Faults Analysis This program has been designed to allow you to do an in-depth analysis of some of the negative aspects or faults of your personality.
It is the partner program to the virtues analysis section of the present authoring program.
It is our hope that constructing a clearer picture of your faults will help you understand the impact of your personality traits on your life in the past, present, and future.

It is probably best to complete this exercise if you are in a normal to good mood, so that you can tolerate the self-criticism.
If you are feeling sad, lonely, or depressed, you should probably do the virtues analysis instead.
This exercise will take you 60-90 minutes, depending on your choices.
You will be asked first to read some information about basic personality theory and then to select 2-10 faults from each of five lists of faults (one list per basic personality trait).

Then you will be presented with the faults you have selected, and asked to choose a final list of the faults you think have most interfered with your life.
You will be asked to write for about 10 minutes, later, for each fault you choose, after you have rank-ordered them in importance.
We recommend that you choose 6-9 faults (for 60 to 90 minutes of work), but you can choose as many as you like.
Justremember that you will be asked to write about each one.
You will be asked to describe how this fault has impacted you negatively, in the past; what you might have done differently; and what you could do now and in the future to rectify or eliminate this fault.

Completing the Exercise 1 During this exercise, you will be presented with a series of pages either providing you with information, or asking you to describe aspects of your personality and experiences.

You may proceed through the exercise by clicking the Next button.

You can go back to previous pages by clicking Previous.

Each time you click Next or Previous, the data you have entered on that page will be saved.
You can also save your data while remaining on the same page by clicking Save.
In addition, many of the pages where you are asked to write for longer periods of time will automatically save every minute or so.

You may quit the exercise any time by clicking Exit/Home or shutting down your browser.

You can come back to the exercise later, and resume your work.
All your previous work will be waiting for you, and will be taken to the last point in the exercise you had completed.

Completing the Exercise 2 On many pages, you will not be able to successfully click Next or Previous unless you have provided a minimum of necessary text.
If you do not, you will receive an error message, and the text box in question will be highlighted in red.
Text boxes also have a maximum length.
Pay attention, as you write, to the numbers above the text boxes.
Numbers like [180 / 1000] indicate that you have typed 180 characters out of a maximum allowable of 1000.
When you go over the maximum, the numbers above the text box become red.

Clicking Next, Previous, or Save will result in an error message and you will not be able to proceed to the Next or Previous page.
To resolve this, edit your text until the number of characters is less than or equal to the maximum.
These limitations have been established so that you do not get stalled at any point in the process.

We do encourage you to write in some detail, however, subject to those limitations.
Our research indicates that better results are obtained as the amount written by participants increases.

There is a progress bar in the top right portion of the screen, which displays the percentage of the exercise that you have already completed.
If you hover over the bar with the mouse, you can see approximately how much time it will still take to complete the exercise.

You may use the Index to jump to any page you have already completed.
Clicking the [Index] link will open the index.
Clicking it again will close it.
Remember to click Save to save any work on the current page before using the index to jump to another page.

After you have completed the exercise, you will be taken to a Summary page.
You can use that page to email yourself a copy of your writing.

=================================================== Part I: Background Knowledge To complete the following exercise, there are a number of things that are useful to know.
(you may have encountered this information previously if you have completed the virtues analysis program, but it might be worthwhile to review it): Everybody's personality is composed of two higher-order traits.
The first higher-order trait is known as plasticity, and can be thought of as the tendency to be flexible, exploratory, curious, and quick to adapt.

The second higher-order trait is known as stability, and can be thought of as the tendency to be structured, organized, emotionally stable and focused.
Plasticity - the first higher-order trait, can be further broken down into two sub-traits: Extraversion (the tendency to be enthusiastic and dominant) and Openness (the tendency to be open-minded and intelligent).

Extraversion (Outgoing vs Reserved) - Sociable - Active - Adventurousness - Positive - Excitement-Seeking - Gregarious Openness (Original vs Traditional) - Fantasy-prone - Aesthetically-minded - Philosophical - Creative - Intuitive - Intellectual Stability - the second higher-order trait, can be further broken down into three sub-traits: Conscientiousness (the tendency to be orderly and industrious), Emotional Stability (lack of negative emotional volatility and the tendency to withdraw), and Agreeableness (politeness and compassion, as opposed to belligerence or aggression).
Conscientiousness (Conscientious vs Carefree) - Competent - Orderly - Decisive - Achievement-oriented - Self-disciplined - Deliberate - Industrious Emotional Stability (Calm vs Nervous) - Anxious (reversed) - Angry (reversed - Hostile (reversed) - Depressed (reversed) - Self-Conscious (reversed) - Vulnerable (reversed) Agreeableness (Agreeable vs Assertive/Aggressive) - Warm - Trusting - Straightforward - Altruistic - Modest - Compliant - Tender-minded - NiceImpact of Personality Traits There are advantages and disadvantages to each trait, particularly at the extremes.
Extremely sociable, extraverted people can be dominant and impulsive, while introverted, quiet people can easily become isolated and depressed.
Extremely open people can be scattered and overwhelmed by their own thoughts and ideas, while closed-minded people may become narrow and inflexible.
Exceptionally conscientious people can be obsessive about order, judgemental and rigid, while their more carefree counterparts may be messy, undisciplined and careless.
People very high in emotional stability may engage in risky, dangerous behavior, while those who are more neurotic can become so preoccupied by anxiety and pain that they are unable to function.
Finally, extremely agreeable people may never stand up for themselves, while those who are too assertive can be aggressive, callous and bullying.

Change Personality is reasonably stable over the lifespan, and is also powerfully influenced by hereditary or genetic factors.
Despite this, personality can broaden or even transform.
As people age, for example, they tend to become more agreeable, conscientious and emotionally stable.

Changing personality means changing habits of action, presumption and perception.
Personality change requires the formulation of clear future goals, as well as discipline and practice.
People who are too agreeable can learn to stand up for themselves.
Disorderly people can become more conscientious.

Introverted people can become socially skilled.
People who experience paralyzing levels of negative emotion can learn to explore.

(b) Alternative Outcome - Write a short paragraph about what you might have done differently in that situation, to minimize the effect of this fault.
